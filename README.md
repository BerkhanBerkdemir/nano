# **[Nano.to](https://nano.to) is a free crypto payment checking API built for the NANO blockchain.** 

Use this API to create payment pages (like Stripe Checkout), Check for payments, and more. Accesible from any internet connected device with a modern web browser. Anonymous, no account or API key required to use.

Launched **September 15th, 2021**.  **We're still in Beta**. API is stable. More endpoints and complex operations are planned in the future. Enterprise planned for late 2022.

[NANO](https://nano.org) is a fee-less, decentralized crypto currency. **We did not built or own NANO.** We simply built a service on top of it. In the process, these public API endpoints were made available. 

**We can't wait to see what you build with it.**

# Basic Usage

```sh
https://nano.to/[NANO_ADDRESS_OR_USERNAME]
```

Example:

```sh
https://nano.to/nano_3gf57qk4agze3ozwfhe8w6oap3jmdb4ofe9qo1ra3wcs5jc888rwyt61ymea
```

Example with a Username:

```sh
https://nano.to/Moon
```

Visit [https://nano.to](https://nano.to/) to reserve your Username.

## Customize

```sh
https://nano.to/[NANO_ADDRESS_OR_USERNAME]?title=Donate&price=50
```

All Options:

```bash
?title=Donate
&price=50
&description=<p>HTML allowed</p>
&suggest=Basic:30,Premium:50
&success_url=https://mywebsite.com/success?id={{id}}
&cancel_url=https://mywebsite.com/
```


The same and more advanced params can be passed in the body of a POST request as so:

```
POST: https://nano.to/[NANO_ADDRESS_OR_USERNAME]
```

```javascript
// npm install axios

axios.post('https://nano.to/[NANO_ADDRESS_OR_USERNAME]', {
    "title": "New Order",
    "plans": [
        { "name": "Fries", "price": 5 },
        { "name": "Burger", "price": 10 },
        { "name": "Happy Meal", "price": 15 },
        { "name": "Cookies üç™", "price": 3 }
    ],
    "business": {
        "name": "McDonalds",
        "logo": "https://www.tailorbrands.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mcdonalds-logo.jpg"
    },
    "success_url": "https://mywebsite.com/success?id={{id}}&anotherParam=hello",
    "cancel_url": "https://google.com",
    "metadata": { "userId": 'joemama' }
})
```

Example response:

```
{
    "id": "666ee7bf26a",
    "url": "https://api.nano.to/checkout/666ee7bf26a",
    "exp": "2021-09-23T01:51:23.853Z"
}
```

You can check the data of a Checkout within it's lifespan by appending '?json=true' to the 'url' as a GET request. 

```
GET: https://api.nano.to/checkout/666ee7bf26a?json=true
```


**Note: While in Beta, API data structure may change, and user data is not being stored. Checkouts are stored in-memory and expire when successful, or after 4 hours, which ever comes first.**

### Check Short Name Status

You can check the status of any name by appending '?check=true' to the url. Even if you do not own it.

For example:

```
https://nano.to/moon?check=true
```

Gives us the following response

```
{
  "name": "moon",
  "status": "Active",
  "expires": "September 16, 2030 7:27 PM EST",
  "created": "September 15, 2021 7:27 PM EST"
}
```

### RAW Amount in QR Codes (Natrium Support)

The API currently supports the following URI schema:

```
nano:nano_3gf57qk4agze3ozwfhe8w6oap3jmdb4ofe9qo1ra3wcs5jc888rwyt61ymea?amount=1000
```

The amount is NOT in MEGA (not RAW). See this [issue](https://github.com/formsend/nano.to/issues/4) for more info.

To force RAW, you can pass an optional url param to force the API to generate RAW friendly QR Codes. 

```
https://nano.to/moon?natrium=true
```

```
https://nano.to/moon?title=Donate&price=10&natrium=true
```

# Advanced Usage (API)


### Base URL

```bash
https://api.nano.to
```

The API is accesed only on HTTPS by GET or POST request. You can use the browser for most GET endpoints. POST requests require something like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a backend server.

---

### Authentication

Nano.to API is free, and open to the world. The API is built to operate 24/7, 365 days per year, globally. 

To use the API you do **not** need an API key. 

Your IP Address is your API key. Don't abuse it.

---

### Rate Limiting

On most endpoints, you can expect to have 5 requests, per second. **This is plenty for most use cases.** Hitting the limit multiple times per day may result in longer lockouts or permanent ban.

If you need lots of simultaneous API calls, please let us know in advanced. 

Email [Formsend](mailto:hello@forward.miami?subject=Nano.to&nbsp;Api&nbsp;Use), subject line 'Nano.to Api Use'.
